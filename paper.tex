        % Do not use inserted blank lines (ie \\) until main body of text.
        \paragraph*{Background:} Gaussian Processes (GP) are an important tool in non-parametric statistics.  They can also be aesthetically pleasing .
      
        \paragraph*{Methods:} I used the Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) Python PyMC GP package to generate cute, random puzzle nubs for making jigsaw puzzles.  This also serves as demonstration and exploration of the 3 parameters of the \Matern covariance function, which is an important, and sometimes confusing mathematical object popular in GP modeling.

        \paragraph*{Results:} The \Matern parameters have a complex interdependence, and setting any one incorrectly can lead to non-nubby puzzle pieces. Furthermore, the non-nubbyness can be similarly accomplished by setting any one of the three parameters incorrectly.

        \paragraph*{Conclusions:} FLOSS math and stats tools are good for recreational math projects, which can also serve as educational tools.  The \Matern covariance function is very expressive, but its parameters are highly interdependent in a way that can be surprising.

\section*{Background}
Wikipedia provides a fine background:
\begin{quote}
In probability theory and statistics] a \emph{Gaussian process} is a
  stochastic process whose realizations consist of random variable
  associated with every point in a range of times (or of space) such
  that each such random variable has a normal distribution. Moreover,
  every finite collection of those random variables has a multivariate
  normal distribution.

Gaussian processes are important in statistical modeling because
of properties inherited from the normal distribution. For example, if
a random process is modeled as a Gaussian process, the distributions
of various derived quantities can be obtained explicitly. Such
quantities include: the average value of the process over a range of
times; the error in estimating the average using sample values at a
small set of times.

A Gaussian process is a stochastic process $\{X_t : t \in T\}$ for
which any finite linear combination of samples will be normally
distributed (or, more generally, any linear functional applied to the
sample function $X_t$ will give a normally distributed result).

Alternatively, a process is Gaussian if and only if for every finite
set of indices $t_{1,\ldots,k}$ in the index set $T$,
\[
 \vec{\mathbf{X}}_{t_1, \ldots, t_k} = (\mathbf{X}_{t_1}, \ldots, \mathbf{X}_{t_k})
\]

is a vector-valued Gaussian
random variable. Using characteristic functions of random variables, the
Gaussian property can be formulated as
follows: $\{X_t : t \in T\}$
is Gaussian if and only if, for every finite set of indices
$t_1, \ldots, t_k$, there are reals
$\sigma_{l j}$ with $\sigma_{ii} > 0$ and reals
$\mu_j$ such that

\[
\operatorname{E}\left(\exp\left(i \ \sum_{\ell=1}^k t_\ell
\ \mathbf{X}_{t_\ell}\right)\right) = \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} \,
\sum_{\ell, j} \sigma_{\ell j} t_\ell t_j + i \sum_\ell \mu_\ell
t_\ell\right).
\]

The numbers $\sigma_{lj}$ and $\mu_j$ can be shown to be the
covariances and means of the variables in
the process \cite{WP:GP}.

The ``\Matern covariance'' (named after the Swedish forestry
statistician Bertil Mat\'{e}rn) is a covariance function used in
spatial statistics, geostatistics, machine learning, image analysis,
and other applications of multivariate statistical analysis on metric
spaces. It is commonly used to define the statistical covariance
between measurements made at two points that are $d$ units distant
from each other. Since the covariance only depends on distances
between points, it is stationary process. If the distance is Euclidean
distance, the Matérn covariance is also isotropic.

The \Matern covariance between two points separated by $d$ distance
units is given by
\[
C(d) =
\sigma^2\frac{1}{\Gamma(\nu)2^{\nu-1}}\Bigg(2\sqrt{\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\Bigg)^\nu
K_\nu\Bigg(2\sqrt{\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\Bigg),
\]

where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function, $K_\nu$ is the modified Bessel
function of the second kind, and $\rho$ and $\nu$ are non-negative
parameters of the covariance.

A Gaussian process with \Matern covariance has sample paths that are
$\lceil \nu-1 \rceil$ times differentiable. As $\nu\rightarrow\infty$,
the \Matern covariance converges to the squared exponential covariance
function
\[
C(d) = \sigma^2\exp(-d^2/\rho^2). \,
\]
When $\nu = 0.5$, the \Matern covariance is identical to the
exponential covariance function \cite{WP:Matern}.
\end{quote}

Following the conventions of the \Matern implementation in the PyMC GP
Package, I call $\sigma$ the amplitude, $\rho$ the scale, and $\nu$
the degree of differentiability.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Methods
%%
%% This should include the design of the study, the setting, the type
%% of participants or materials involved, a clear description of all
%% interventions and comparisons, and the type of analysis used,
%% including a power calculation if appropriate.

\section*{Methods}
The Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) package PyMC has an
efficient set of Gaussian Process routines, including an
implementation of the \Matern covariance function.  In order to use
this to generate the nubs for jigsaw puzzles, I designed a set of
``observations'' which lead a pair of GPs through the contortions expected of a jigsaw puzzle nub (Fig.~\ref{fig:controls}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{fig1.pdf}
\caption{Two Gaussian Processes (panel a) for $x(t)$ and panel b) for
  $y(t)$ with \Matern covariance functions and 7 ``observations'' that
  look like a puzzle nub when plotted as a two dimensional function of
  time (panel c).  The GP realizations (solid red lines) show the
  results of choosing good nub-like parameters for the \Matern
  covariance function of $\sigma = 1, \rho = 1.5, \nu = 2$.}
\label{fig:controls}
\end{figure}

Realizing this GP is straightforward with PyMC, requiring little more
than the following code:
\begin{verbatim}
M, C = uninformative_prior_gp(0., diff_degree, amp, scale)
gp.observe(M, C, data.puzzle_t, data.puzzle_x, data.puzzle_V)
GPx = gp.GPSubmodel('GP', M, C, pl.arange(1))
X = GPx.value.f(pl.arange(0., 1.0001, 1. / steps))
\end{verbatim}

By mapping the nubs from these pairs of GPs to the edges of graphs
embedded in the plane, I automatically generated random puzzles (for
example, Fig~\ref{fig:puzzle}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig2.pdf}
\caption{A small, randomly generated puzzle, using pairs of Gaussian
  Processes with \Matern covariance functions and 7 ``observations''
  when good nub-like parameters for the \Matern covariance function
  ($\sigma = 1, \rho = 1.5, \nu = 2$) are selected.}
\label{fig:puzzle}
\end{figure}

To explore the effects of the amplitude, scale, and degree of
differentiability parameters, I varied each parameter individually
through a range of values, while holding the other two fixed at good
parameters for puzzle nubs.

%% Results  %%
%%
%% The Results and Discussion may be combined into a single section or
%% presented separately. Results of statistical analysis should
%% include, where appropriate, relative and absolute risks or risk
%% reductions, and confidence intervals. The results and discussion
%% sections may also be broken into subsections with short,
%% informative headings.

\section*{Results and Discussion}
The results are summarized by Fig~\ref{fig:vary}.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig3.pdf}
\caption{Realizations of GP puzzle pieces with varying \Matern
  parameters, using pairs of Gaussian Processes with \Matern
  covariance functions and 7 ``observations''.  The parameters not
  listed in each row are the nub-like parameters $\sigma = 1, \rho =
  1.5,$ and/or $\nu = 2$.}
\label{fig:vary}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig~\ref{fig:vary}, the \Matern parameters have a complex
interdependence structure, and setting any one incorrectly can lead to
e non-nubby puzzle pieces.  The middle column of the figure shows the
nubby settings, while the entry with $\sigma=.25$ looks qualitatively
very similar to that with $\rho = 3.00$ and also $\nu = 4.00$.

\section*{Conclusions}
GPs are an important tool in non-parametric statistics, but be careful
with the parameters, because they have complex interdependencies.
