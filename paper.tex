%% 
%% In order to give appropriate credit to each author of a paper, the
%% individual contributions of authors to the manuscript should be
%% specified in this section.

%% An ``author'' is generally considered to be someone who has made
%% substantive intellectual contributions to a published study. To
%% qualify as an author one should 1) have made substantial
%% contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or
%% analysis and interpretation of data; 2) have been involved in
%% drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important
%% intellectual content; and 3) have given final approval of the
%% version to be published. Each author should have participated
%% sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for
%% appropriate portions of the content. Acquisition of funding,
%% collection of data, or general supervision of the research group,
%% alone, does not justify authorship.

%% We suggest the following kind of format (please use initials to
%% refer to each author's contribution): AB carried out the molecular
%% genetic studies, participated in the sequence alignment and drafted
%% the manuscript. JY carried out the immunoassays. MT participated in
%% the sequence alignment. ES participated in the design of the study
%% and performed the statistical analysis. FG conceived of the study,
%% and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft
%% the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

%% All contributors who do not meet the criteria for authorship should
%% be listed in an acknowledgements section. Examples of those who
%% might be acknowledged include a person who provided purely
%% technical help, writing assistance, or a department chair who
%% provided only general support.

\section*{Authors contributions}

%% You may choose to use this section to include any relevant
%% information about the author(s) that may aid the reader’s
%% interpretation of the article, and understand the standpoint of the
%% author(s). This may include details about the authors'
%% qualifications, current positions they hold at institutions or
%% societies, or any other relevant background information. Please
%% refer to authors using their initials. Note this section should not
%% be used to describe any competing interests.

\section*{Tables}
  \subsection*{Table 1 - Sample table title}
    Here is an example of a \emph{small} table in \LaTeX\ using  
    \verb|\tabular{...}|. This is where the description of the table 
    should go. \par \mbox{}
    \par
    \mbox{
      \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{My Table}\\ \hline
        A1 & B2  & C3 \\ \hline
        A2 & ... & .. \\ \hline
        A3 & ..  & .  \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}
      }
  \subsection*{Table 2 - Sample table title}
    Large tables are attached as separate files but should
    still be described here.
